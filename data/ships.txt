	description "This ship has been modified by the Unfettered Hai, after that they succesfully invaded Wanderer space. Their primary intention was to increase the weapon space to install more Ion Cannons, but since they were unable to do much they focused on the Solifuge development and, after it was completed, tried to increase the other attributes instead with good results at the cost of manuevrability and heat control."
