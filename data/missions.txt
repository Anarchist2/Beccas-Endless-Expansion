			`When you land, you open your ship's door and you start walking towards the main Kraz Cybernetics building. This time, you don't even have to give your name to the receptionist; as soon as she sees you, she says: "Welcome, Captain <last>! Barmy Edward is waiting for you in building 13, second floor, room 9." The whole buliding 13 reveals to be a weapon testing laboratory, with the second floor being focused on rifles testing. Barmy is in front of the room's door, with a smile on his face. He looks quite excited. "<first>! Long time no see. Are you ready to see the most beautiful thing in your life?"`
			choice
				`	"Absolutely!"`
				`	"Why all this haste?"`
				`	"What's behind that door?"`
			`"Follow me" he says. He lays his hand on a device similar to a scanner next to the door, then types something on a pad which opens the door. The room is a rifle range, with some targets on the far side that start moving on some rails as soon as Barmy presses a switch. "For many decades, here at Kraz, we tried to understand enough about the Heavy Lasers to improve them. The Deep, once again, beat us with their fantastic Electron Beam. While we haven't been able to replicate them, our previous studies on the laser technology haven't been a total waste of time, but I guess you will judge that yourself." He opens a safe box and takes out a large rifle.`
			scene "outfit/heavy laser rifle"
			`"The Laser Rifle is older than any other laser currently used," he says "a piece of technology less complicated to understand, and to improve. I'm not saying it was easy, of course" he adds, hiding a smile.`

			`	"Well, first of all, it will be more useful at defending than covering your ship and your crew with explosives," he says, with such a tone that you can't say if he was just sarcastic or also a little irritated. "Not to mention," he adds," the fact they are barely legal, and could be banished one day. At least, I wouldn't start launching explosives in a ship where the smallest hole would kill you soon. Anyways, you can try it yourself. Shoot at those moving targets."`

			`	You kneel down and you try to aim. It is surprisingly comfortable to hold for such a heavy weapon. As soon as you press the trigger, it fires a fast succession of yellow-green shots that pierce through the target and set on fire the wall behind it. When you look at Barmy, you notice he has a large smile on his face.`
			choice
				`	"How long until I can buy this?"`
			`	"Hardly more than a week, the production line is almost completed. But you can keep the one you are holding. I don't need it, and I don't think anybody will be worried when they hear your name, <first>. You are somewhat of a celebrity here."`

Ever since you first made contact with the void sprite(s), we have been developing an improved gascraft to make better use of modern construction techniques and advanced instrumentation."`
			`	With the Archon no longer attacking our ships, we've been allocated sufficient resources to complete a working prototype of this new design, one we're calling the Robin. It's still in early development, and we aren't confident in how it will handle frequent trips to Nenia and back. But the shipyard on <planet> has begun mass producing them, and you might see our young pilots training in them around some of our home worlds."`
